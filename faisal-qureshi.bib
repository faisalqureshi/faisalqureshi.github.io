The BAR encompasses and provides visualization tools for large ‘omics data sets from plants. The BAR covers data from Arabidopsis, tomato, wheat, barley and 29 other plant species (with data for 2 others to be released soon). These data include nucleotide and protein sequence data, gene expression data, protein-protein and protein–DNA interactions, protein structures, subcellular localizations, and polymorphisms. The data are stored in more than 200 relational databases holding 186 GB of data and are presented to the researchers via web apps. These web apps provide data analysis and visualization tools. Some of the most popular tools are eFP (‘electronic fluorescent pictograph’) Browsers, ePlants and ThaleMine (an Arabidopsis-specific instance of InterMine). The BAR was designated a Global Core Biodata Resource in 2023. Like other GCBRs, the BAR has excellent operational stability, provides access without login requirement, and provides an API for researchers to be able to access BAR data programmatically. We present in this update a new overarching search tool called Gaia that permits easy access to all BAR data, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.}",

  abstract={We present a method for hyperspectral pixel unmixing. The proposed method assumes that (1) abundances can be encoded as Dirichlet distributions and (2) spectra of endmembers can be represented as multivariate Normal distributions. The method solves the problem of abundance estimation and endmember extraction within a variational autoencoder setting where a Dirichlet bottleneck layer models the abundances, and the decoder performs endmember extraction. The proposed method can also leverage transfer learning paradigm, where the model is only trained on synthetic data containing pixels that are linear combinations of one or more endmembers of interest. In this case, we retrieve endmembers (spectra) from the United States Geological Survey Spectral Library. The model thus trained can be subsequently used to perform pixel unmixing on “real data” that contains a subset of the endmembers used to generated the synthetic data. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: Cuprite, Urban Hydice and Samson. We also present new synthetic dataset, OnTech-HSI-Syn-21, that can be used to study hyperspectral pixel unmixing methods. We showcase the transfer learning capabilities of the proposed model on Cuprite and OnTech-HSI-Syn-21 datasets. In summary, the proposed method can be applied for pixel unmixing a variety of domains, including agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, analysis of materials, healthcare, etc. Additionally, the proposed method eschews the need for labelled data for training by leveraging the transfer learning paradigm, where the model is trained on synthetic data generated using the endmembers present in the “real” data.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is valuable for many applications. In this context, unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning methods that estimate how normal a new observation is have shown promising results on benchmark datasets. These methods are dependent on a threshold that determines which points should be regarded as anomalous and not be anomalous. However, finding the optimal threshold is not easy since no information about the ground truth is known in advance, which implies that there are limitations to automatic threshold-setting methods available today. An alternative is to utilize the expertise of users that can interact in a threshold-setting procedure, but for this to be practically feasible, the method needs to be both accurate and efficient in relation to the state-of-the-art automatic methods. Therefore, this study develops an interactive threshold-setting schema and examines to what extent it can outperform the current state-of-the-art automatic threshold-setting methods. The result of the study strongly indicates that the suggested method with little effort can provide higher accuracy than the automatic threshold-setting methods on a general basis.},

ABSTRACT = {Powered wheelchairs have enhanced the mobility and quality of life of people with special needs. The next step in the development of powered wheelchairs is to incorporate sensors and electronic systems for new control applications and capabilities to improve their usability and the safety of their operation, such as obstacle avoidance or autonomous driving. However, autonomous powered wheelchairs require safe navigation in different environments and scenarios, making their development complex. In our research, we propose, instead, to develop contactless control for powered wheelchairs where the position of the caregiver is used as a control reference. Hence, we used a depth camera to recognize the caregiver and measure at the same time their relative distance from the powered wheelchair. In this paper, we compared two different approaches for real-time object recognition using a 3DHOG hand-crafted object descriptor based on a 3D extension of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and a convolutional neural network based on YOLOv4-Tiny. To evaluate both approaches, we constructed Miun-Feet&mdash;a custom dataset of images of labeled caregiver&rsquo;s feet in different scenarios, with backgrounds, objects, and lighting conditions. The experimental results showed that the YOLOv4-Tiny approach outperformed 3DHOG in all the analyzed cases. In addition, the results showed that the recognition accuracy was not improved using the depth channel, enabling the use of a monocular RGB camera only instead of a depth camera and reducing the computational cost and heat dissipation limitations. Hence, the paper proposes an additional method to compute the caregiver&rsquo;s distance and angle from the Powered Wheelchair (PW) using only the RGB data. This work shows that it is feasible to use the location of the caregiver&rsquo;s feet as a control signal for the control of a powered wheelchair and that it is possible to use a monocular RGB camera to compute their relative positions.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection for sky surveillance is a challenging problem due to having small objects in a large volume and a constantly changing background which requires high resolution frames. For example, detecting flying birds in wind farms to prevent their collision with the wind turbines. This paper proposes a YOLOv4-based ensemble model for bird detection in grayscale videos captured around wind turbines in wind farms. In order to tackle this problem, we introduce two datasets—(1) Klim and (2) Skagen—collected at two locations in Denmark. We use Klim training set to train three increasingly capable YOLOv4 based models. Model 1 uses YOLOv4 trained on the Klim dataset, Model 2 introduces tiling to improve small bird detection, and the last model uses tiling and temporal stacking and achieves the best mAP values on both Klim and Skagen datasets. We used this model to set up an ensemble detector, which further improves mAP values on both datasets. The three models achieve testing mAP values of 82%, 88%, and 90% on the Klim dataset. mAP values for Model 1 and Model 3 on the Skagen dataset are 60% and 92%. Improving object detection accuracy could mitigate birds’ mortality rate by choosing the locations for such establishment and the turbines location. It can also be used to improve the collision avoidance systems used in wind energy facilities.},

abstract = {Optimal scale selection for image segmentation is an essential component of the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and interpretation. An optimal segmentation scale is a scale at which image objects, overall, best represent real-world ground objects and features across the entire image. At this scale, the intra-object variance is ideally lowest and the inter-object spatial autocorrelation is ideally highest, and a change in the scale could cause an abrupt change in these measures. Unsupervised parameter optimization methods typically use global measures of spatial and spectral properties calculated from all image objects in all bands as the target criteria to determine the optimal segmentation scale. However, no studies consider the effect of noise in image spectral bands on the segmentation assessment and scale selection. Furthermore, these global measures could be affected by outliers or extreme values from a small number of objects. These issues may lead to incorrect assessment and selection of optimal scales and cause the uncertainties in subsequent segmentation and classification results. These issues become more pronounced when segmenting hyperspectral data with large spectral variability across the spectrum. In this study, we propose an enhanced method that 1) incorporates the band’s inverse noise weighting in the segmentation and 2) detects and removes outliers before determining segmentation scale parameters. The proposed method is evaluated on three well-established segmentation approaches – k-means, mean-shift, and watershed. The generated segments are validated by comparing them with reference polygons using normalized over-segmentation (OS), under-segmentation (US), and the Euclidean Distance (ED) indices. The results demonstrate that this proposed scale selection method produces more accurate and reliable segmentation results. The approach can be applied to other segmentation selection criteria and are useful for automatic multi-parameter tuning and optimal scale parameter selections in OBIA methods in remote sensing.}
