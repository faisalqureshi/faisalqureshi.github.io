%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (12pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, extrawide draft margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all),
%% `extrawidemarginsdraft (1" left, 3" right).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.
