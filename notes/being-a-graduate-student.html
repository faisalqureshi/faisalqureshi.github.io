<h2 id="punctuality">Punctuality</h2>
<p>If a meeting’s start time is, say, 9 am. I expect you to be there and
ready for the meeting by 8:55 am. I make every effort to get to our
meetings on time. I realize that many times I am myself not on time, my
lateness; however, doesn’t excuse the fact many of you are unable to
make it on time to many of our meetings.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that these meetings should not be mistaken with
undergraduate lectures, where we see a number of students sauntering
into the lecture room, biting into a sandwich, 20 minutes after the
class start time. Such behaviour is rarely tolerated in professional
settings. Graduate school is like a job in this regards.</p>
<h2 id="group-meetings">Group meetings</h2>
<p>Group meetings are not optional. If for some reason you are unable to
make it to a group meeting, please let me know in advance explaining the
reasons why you cannot make it to a meeting.</p>
<h2 id="ta-duties-and-office-hours">TA duties and Office Hours</h2>
<p>TAs are not permitted to host office hours in the lab. This is
disruptive to other students and presents a security risk. Please talk
to your TA coordinator about booking a consultation room.</p>
<h2 id="computer-science-seminar-series">Computer Science Seminar
Series</h2>
<p>Attendance at the weekly seminar series is <em>mandatory</em> for all
members (including honours thesis students) unless excused. Watch for
announcements.</p>
<h2 id="lab-environment">Lab Environment</h2>
<p>If you find the lab too hot / too cold or there are maintenance
issues, bring them to my attention immediately and they will contact
facilities directly. Similarly, if there are equipment problems
(anything from computers to chairs), let the lab coordinator know. These
things should not interfere with your ability to do your work. Please,
DO NOT attempt to solve these problems for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="lab-attendance">Lab Attendance</h2>
<p>I expect you to be in the lab for a significant portion of every
working day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To create a collegial environment</strong> which is lively
and energizing. This is something you have asked for. I often hear the
suggestion that the way to make the lab a better place is to have more
students in there. It doesn’t work if 5-6 students don’t show up on any
given day.</li>
<li><strong>To ensure your progress</strong>. Graduate school is like a
job – a tough job with low pay and high expectations! I get that it’s
hard and at times you need a break. But, if you maintain some regularity
in your working hours, it develops some level of discipline and leads to
progress on your projects. Finishing your degree on time (or at all) is
contingent on putting in the requisite hours, which, I’m afraid to say,
are more than usual full-time hours (40 hours or more!)</li>
<li><strong>To improve our working relationship</strong>. I can’t help
you if I don’t see you around. Also, I will be writing your reference
letters and I want to be able to say so-and-so is hard working,
reliable, always attends meetings, regularly provides updates and meets
milestones, etc. I will not say these things if they are not true.<br />
</li>

<h2 id="a-respectful-friendly-and-collegial-environment">A Respectful,
Friendly and Collegial Environment</h2>
<p>Remember that the lab is a shared space. Be considerate of others.
Help each other. Try to create an environment that fosters creativity
and friendships. I cannot stress enough that you have a unique
opportunity to make connections and establish friendships that will last
a lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>I will request that you keep food consumption in the lab to a
minimum. UOIT has spaces that you can use to have a meal. Water and
coffee is okay.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-tidy">Keeping it Tidy</h2>
<p>Please ensure that your desk is clean and tidy. Many a times we have
lab visitors. An untidy lab looks unprofessional.</p>
<h2 id="access">Access</h2>
<p>The lab is restricted to students assigned to the room and all CS
Faculty. Visitors, of course, are permitted on occasion, but it is
expected that if you have visitors, you will keep your conversations to
a level that will not disturb the work of others.</p>
<h2 id="progress-report-and-reference-letter">Progress Report and
Reference Letter</h2>
<p>Please read this advice.</p>
