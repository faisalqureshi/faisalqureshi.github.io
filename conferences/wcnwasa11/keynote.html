    </h3>
    <p> Recent hardware innovations have produced low-power, embedded computers equipped with small cameras, which can be organized into wireless camera sensor networks. These new technologies provide a tremendous opportunity to devise new applications at the intersection of computer vision and sensor networks. However, such applications pose a number of fundamental challenges to the state-of-the-art. On the one hand, traditional computer vision are centralized and require computational resources not available in a camera sensor network. On the other hand, traditional sensor networks techniques have been developed to solve only simple problems, such as averaging. They are not designed to deal with the presence outliers and non-linear data, which are common in computer vision applications. In this talk we will show how existing algorithms can be combined and extended to provide robust distributed solutions for computer vision applications in camera sensor networks.</p></td>

    </h3>
      <p>Realistic virtual worlds can serve as software laboratories within which vision researchers may prolifically develop and evaluate sophisticated, active machine perception systems. This unorthodox &quot;Virtual Vision&quot; paradigm is posited at the intersection of the fields of computer vision and computer graphics such that virtual reality can subserve computer vision research. A consequence of this paradigm, upon which I will focus in this talk, is our recent work on the rapid development and evaluation of distributed smart camera sensor networks and intelligent surveillance systems capable of persistent human observation in large-scale, visually realistic virtual environments populated by autonomous virtual humans.</p></td>
