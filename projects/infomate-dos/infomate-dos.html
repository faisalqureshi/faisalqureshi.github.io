<p class="cursive-text" style="font-style: bolder;">
I worked on this piece of software in mid 1990s. I was able to recover
the source code and I used Claude to examine the source code and provide
me with a short description. What you read below is what Claude
returned. The coolest bit is that I was able to run the code (the .EXE)
file in <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>. I screen recorded
the program in action.
</p>
<p class="cursive-text" style="font-style: bolder;">
This was a collaborative effort. I was part of a team led by <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/s-mahmood-ahmed-604255/">Syed Mahmood
Ahmed Sahib</a>. I was responsible for the application
development—wireframe and shaded 3D rendering and animation. This
application uses a DOS based UI framework that I had written a year
earlier for my course assignments, back when Windows 95 wasn’t out yet.
Others dealt with mathematics of forward and inverse kinematics.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><em>Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)</em></p>
<p>InfoMate DOS is a sophisticated robotics kinematics analysis and
simulation application developed in the mid-1990s, representing a
remarkable achievement in DOS-era software engineering. Built entirely
with Borland C/C++ across just 23 source files, this compact application
demonstrates the ingenuity required to create advanced technical
software within the constraints of early 1990s computing.</p>
<p>The application models a cylindrical coordinate robot (with
rotational joint θ and prismatic joints d2, d3) and provides
comprehensive kinematics analysis through forward and inverse solvers.
Users can specify joint parameters to visualize the resulting
end-effector position, or input a desired Cartesian position and let the
inverse kinematics solver calculate the necessary joint
configurations—complete with multiple solution analysis for ambiguous
poses.</p>
<p>InfoMate comes in two versions: InfoWire.exe (89KB), featuring
wire-frame visualization, and Info3D1.exe (91KB), an enhanced simulator
with solid 3D rendering and smooth animation using double-buffered
page-flipping techniques. The 3D engine implements custom transformation
matrices, perspective projection, and back-face culling—all using
software rendering through the Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) for
EGA/VGA displays.</p>
<p>What’s particularly impressive is the custom GUI framework built from
scratch, predating modern UI libraries. The developers implemented their
own complete windowing system with mouse event handling (via direct BIOS
interrupts using int86), 3D-styled buttons with highlighting effects,
modal dialog boxes, text input fields, and real-time parameter displays.
The system even includes audio feedback with PC speaker beeps during
robot motion, creating a more engaging user experience.</p>
<p>This application represents both a technical accomplishment and an
educational tool, making complex robotics concepts accessible through
interactive visualization during an era when such educational software
was rare and typically required expensive workstations.</p>
<h3 id="running-infomate-dos-today">Running InfoMate DOS Today</h3>
<p>Despite being developed over 30 years ago, both DOS versions of
InfoMate remain fully functional and playable today through DOSBox, the
popular DOS emulation software. The applications launch seamlessly via
provided shell scripts (run-infowire.sh for wire-frame mode,
run-info3d.sh for 3D simulation), requiring no modifications to the
original executables. Modern users can experience the complete
interface: clicking through the custom-built GUI with mouse support,
opening dialog boxes to input joint parameters or Cartesian coordinates,
watching the real-time 3D wire-frame or solid robot visualization
respond to forward kinematics calculations, and hearing the authentic PC
speaker beeps that accompany robot motion. The InfoWire.exe version
(89KB) provides the core kinematics analysis experience with its clean
wire-frame graphics running smoothly in EGA/VGA mode, while Info3D1.exe
(91KB) showcases the more advanced 3D simulation with solid rendering
and smooth animation through double-buffered graphics.</p>
<h3 id="preservation-and-accessibility">Preservation and
Accessibility</h3>
<p>The fact that these applications run flawlessly in emulation
demonstrates the value of software preservation and the robustness of
well-engineered DOS programs. All required dependencies—the EGAVGA.BGI
graphics driver and LITT.CHR/TRIP.CHR font files—are included and
properly configured. Users can interact with the original button-based
interface, experiment with different robot configurations, observe how
inverse kinematics computes multiple solutions, and appreciate the
engineering achievement of delivering sophisticated 3D graphics and
real-time kinematics calculations on early 1990s hardware (486 or early
Pentium processors). This accessibility transforms InfoMate from merely
archived code into living educational software that students, robotics
enthusiasts, and software historians can explore firsthand—experiencing
both the robotics concepts it teaches and the ingenuity of early PC
application development. The applications serve as interactive museum
pieces, demonstrating that thoughtfully designed software can transcend
its original platform and remain functional and valuable decades
later.</p>
