I worked on this piece of software in mid 1990s. I was able to recover
the source code and I used Claude to examine the source code and provide
me with a short description. What you read below is what Claude
returned. The coolest bit is that I was able to run the code (the .EXE)
file in <a
href="https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows95">windows95</a>. I
screen recorded the program in action.
</p>
<p class="cursive-text" style="font-style: bolder;">
This was a collaborative effort. I was part of a team led by <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/s-mahmood-ahmed-604255/">Syed Mahmood
Ahmed Sahib</a>. I was responsible for the application development,
including the 3D rendering library that this application used for
visualization plus the graphing library that was used to generate plots.
Others were responsible for wrangling the kinematics equations and
trajectory planning mathematics. One of my favorite memories from those
times is having tea, first around 10 am and then at 3:30 pm. A peon
(<em>in South and Southeast Asia, an attendant, orderly, or an
assistant</em>) would bring black tea (steeped), along with sugar, and
powdered milk, usually Nido. It was delicious. The tea was covered by
our employer :-)

We published this work back in 1997.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><em>Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)</em></p>
<p>InfoMate for Windows 95 represents a major evolutionary leap from the
DOS version, transforming a compact kinematics analyzer into a
sophisticated, production-quality engineering application. Built with
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) 4.0
framework, this 564KB executable demonstrates professional software
architecture and engineering practices from the mid-1990s Windows
development era. The application comprises over 217 source files
organized into a carefully structured four-layer architecture,
showcasing the complexity possible even before modern development
frameworks and tools.</p>
<h3 id="architecture-and-technical-foundation">Architecture and
Technical Foundation</h3>
<p>The codebase exhibits remarkable modularity through its layered
design. At the foundation lies a comprehensive custom 3D graphics
library (62 .CPP and 75 .H files) implementing a complete actor-based
rendering system with support for animations, sprite management, polygon
rendering, camera systems, scene graphs, and sophisticated color
management through lookup tables (CLUTs) supporting 8-bit palette mode,
15-bit, and 24-bit true color rendering. This graphics layer interfaces
with WinG (Windows Graphics Library), Microsoft’s pre-DirectX graphics
API from 1994-1996 designed for fast bitmap graphics. Above this sits a
simulation layer with custom 3D body representations (F3dBody), polygon
objects (FPolyObj), world/scene management (FWorld), camera controllers
(FCamera), and graphing subsystems (FGraph, FGraphData). The domain
layer implements the robotics-specific mathematics through InfoMath,
InfoMotion, trajectory planning classes (JointTraj, CarTraj), and
parameter management, while the application layer provides the MFC-based
user interface with document/view architecture and 46+ specialized
dialog boxes.</p>
<h3 id="core-kinematics-and-analysis-features">Core Kinematics and
Analysis Features</h3>
<p>The Windows version retains and enhances all DOS capabilities for
robot kinematics analysis. The forward kinematics solver (ForwardDlg)
calculates end-effector position and orientation from joint parameters,
while the inverse kinematics solver (InvDlg) computes joint
configurations needed to achieve a desired Cartesian position—a
computationally intensive task involving solving nonlinear equations. A
unique feature is the multiple solution analysis system (2SoluDlg,
2SoluSeeDlg) that identifies and visualizes different robot
configurations (elbow-up vs. elbow-down, for example) that can achieve
the same end-effector position, allowing engineers to select optimal
configurations based on workspace constraints, singularity avoidance, or
energy efficiency. The application provides real-time numerical displays
of joint parameters (θ₁, d₂, d₃, θ₄, θ₅, θ₆), Cartesian positions (x, y,
z), and orientation angles with synchronized 3D visualization.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-trajectory-planning-and-motion-analysis">Advanced
Trajectory Planning and Motion Analysis</h3>
<p>Beyond static position analysis, InfoMate excels at trajectory
planning and motion simulation—critical capabilities for programming
industrial robots. The joint space trajectory planner (JointTDlg)
generates smooth motion paths using cubic polynomial interpolation,
quintic polynomials, or optimal trajectory algorithms, allowing users to
specify initial and final joint configurations, motion time, and
velocity/acceleration constraints. The Cartesian trajectory planner
(CarTraj) is even more sophisticated, planning paths in 3D Cartesian
space (straight lines, curves) and automatically computing the joint
space trajectories needed to execute them—a computationally demanding
process involving continuous inverse kinematics calculations and
interpolation. The application includes motion statistics analysis
(MotionStatDlg) displaying velocity and acceleration profiles over time,
graphing subsystems that plot joint positions, velocities, and
accelerations as functions of time, and trajectory violation detection
that warns when planned motions exceed joint limits or
velocity/acceleration constraints. Users can replay trajectories forward
or backward, pause during execution, and visualize the robot’s path with
animated 3D trail rendering showing the end-effector’s trajectory
through space.</p>
<h3 id="d-graphics-and-visualization">3D Graphics and Visualization</h3>
<p>The visualization system represents a substantial technical
achievement for mid-1990s software rendering. The application implements
a complete 3D rendering pipeline with perspective projection, hidden
surface removal via back-face culling, and support for both wire-frame
and solid polygon rendering modes. The camera system (CameraDlg)
provides extensive control with six degrees of freedom: translation
along X/Y/Z axes, rotation (heading, pitch, bank/roll), and zoom—all
controllable via menu commands, keyboard shortcuts, or toolbar buttons
with real-time visual feedback. Users can toggle display of the global
coordinate frame, end-effector coordinate frame, and a ground grid for
spatial reference. The world can be rendered in multiple modes: robot
hidden, wire-frame only, or fully shaded solid rendering. The animation
system uses double-buffered page flipping for smooth motion without
flicker, a sophisticated technique requiring careful memory management
and synchronization with the display hardware.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-and-interaction-design">User Interface and
Interaction Design</h3>
<p>The application showcases professional-quality GUI design using MFC’s
full capabilities. Beyond standard menus and toolbars, InfoMate features
modal and modeless dialogs for different analysis modes, allowing users
to keep camera controls or parameter displays visible while working with
other features. The interface includes real-time parameter displays
showing current joint angles, Cartesian positions, and orientations that
update dynamically during motion or camera movement. Dialog boxes for
trajectory planning (TrajSpcDlg) include input validation, range
checking, and visual feedback. The application implements comprehensive
menu command state management—menu items and toolbar buttons
enable/disable appropriately based on application state (motion running,
trajectory defined, etc.)—demonstrating attention to professional UI/UX
design. Context menus provide quick access to common operations, and
keyboard shortcuts (with visual indicators) accelerate expert user
workflows. The splash screen, About dialog, and consistent visual
styling create a polished, commercial-grade appearance.</p>
<h3 id="historical-and-educational-significance">Historical and
Educational Significance</h3>
<p>InfoMate for Windows 95 represents both a technical accomplishment
and valuable educational tool from an era when specialized engineering
software was rare and expensive. Developed during the mid-1990s
transition from DOS to Windows, it demonstrates the challenges and
opportunities of that period: moving from text-mode and simple graphics
to rich GUIs, from single-tasking to multitasking environments, and from
direct hardware access to API-mediated graphics. The reliance on WinG
rather than DirectX (released in late 1995) places this precisely in the
early Windows 95 era, using one of Microsoft’s first attempts at
accelerated graphics before gaming APIs matured. The application makes
complex robotics concepts—forward/inverse kinematics, trajectory
planning, workspace analysis—accessible through interactive
visualization at a time when such tools typically required expensive
Silicon Graphics workstations or CAD systems. As preserved software, it
offers insights into 1990s development practices: MFC’s document/view
patterns, resource files for UI definition, ClassWizard-generated code,
and the substantial effort required to build custom 3D graphics engines
before modern libraries and GPU acceleration. The complete distribution
with runtime DLLs (MFC40.DLL at 900KB, MSVCRT40.DLL at 306KB)
illustrates the deployment challenges of that era, when developers had
to bundle substantial runtimes with applications—a stark contrast to
today’s lightweight web applications or containerized deployment.</p>
