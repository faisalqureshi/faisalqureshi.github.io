  <p>In Fig. 1, assignment 1 is reactive. Here,
  the cameras do not take into account the future effects of their
  current assignments, which leads to observation failures when the
  pedestrian depicted as the red circle is handed-off from camera 3 to
  camera 1. Planning allows the three cameras to observe the two
  individuals&mdash;depicted as red circle and green square&mdash;without any
  interruptions (assignment 2).</p>

    <h3>Cameras Handoffs using Planning
    [<a href="icdsc09-pretasking.mov">video1</a>, <a href="Planner4.wmv">video2</a>]</h3>
    <p>Three cameras decide among themselves how best to observe two
    pedestrians as they cross each other.  One of the three cameras assists the other two
    in performing a successful handoff. It goes back to idle once the
    handoff is complete. Its role is similar to that of a temporary
    variable when values of two variables are swapped.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>We present a visual sensor network, comprising wide field-of-view (FOV) passive cameras and pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) active cameras, which automatically captures high quality surveillance video of selected pedestrians during their prolonged presence in an area of interest. A wide-FOV static camera can track multiple pedestrians, while any PTZ active camera can follow a single pedestrian at a time. The proactive control of multiple PTZ cameras is required to record seamless, high quality video of a roaming individual despite the observational constraints of the different cameras. We formulate PTZ camera assignment and handoff as a planning problem whose solution achieves optimal camera assignment with respect to predefined observational goals.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
                    This paper introduces a camera network capable of
automatically learning proactive control strategies that enable
a set of active pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) cameras, supported by wideFOV passive cameras, to provide persistent coverage of the scene.
When a situation is encountered for the ﬁrst time, a reasoning
module performs PTZ camera assignments and handoffs. The
results of this reasoning exercise are 1) generalized so as to
be applicable to many other similar situations and 2) stored
in a production system for later use. When a "similar” situation is encountered in the future, the production-system reacts
instinctively and performs camera assignments and handoffs,
bypassing the reasoning module. Over time the proposed camera
network reduces its reliance on the reasoning module to perform
camera assignments and handoffs, consequently becoming more
responsive and computationally efficient.
