      <p>Cameras are now ubiquitous. This has resulted in an explosive growth
in user-generated images and videos. In the case of videos, at least,
our ability to record videos has far outpaced methods and tools to
manage these videos. A skier, for example, can easily record many hours
of video footage using an action camera, such as a Go-Pro. Raw video
footage, in general, is unviewable—the recorded video needs to be
summarized or edited in some manner before it can be shared with others.
Clearly, no one is interested in watching many hours of skiing video
when most of it is bound to be highly repetitive. Manual video editing
and summarizing is painstakingly slow and tedious. Consequently a large
fraction of recorded footage is never shared or even viewed. We
desperately need one-touch video editing tools capable of generating
video summarizes that capture the meaningful and interesting portions of
the video, dis- carding sections that are boring, repetitive or poorly
recorded. Such tools will revolutionize how we share video stories with
friends and family via social media.</p>
<p>These observations has led us to explore new theory and methods for
video summarization.</p>

<p>We present a method for creating video summaries in real-time on
commodity hardware. Real-time here refers to the fact that the time
required for video summarization is less than the duration of the input
video. First, low-level features are use to discard undesirable frames.
Next, video is divided into segments, and segment-level features are
extracted for each segment. Tree-based models trained on widely
available video summarization and computational aesthetics datasets are
then used to rank individual segments, and top-ranked segments are
selected to generate the final video summary. We evaluate the proposed
method on The SumMe Video Summarization (SumMe) dataset and show that
our method is able to achieve summarization accuracy that is comparable
to that of a current state-of-the-art deep learning method, while
posting significantly faster run-times. Our method on average is able to
generate a video summary in time that is shorter than the duration of
the video.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>
<p>We present a new framework for capturing videos using sensor-rich
mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc. Many of today’s
mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors, including
accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes, which are rarely used
during video capture for anything more than video stabilization. We
demonstrate that these sensors, together with the information that can
be extracted from the recorded video via computer vi- sion techniques,
provide a rich source of data that can be leveraged to automatically
edit and “clean up” the captured video. Sensor data, for example, can be
used to identify un- desirable video segments that are then hidden from
view. We showcase an Android video recording app that captures sensor
data during video recording and is capable of automatically constructing
final-cuts from the recorded video. The app uses the captured sensor
data plus computer vision algorithms, such as focus analysis, face
detection, etc., to filter out undesirable segments and keep visually
appealing portions of the captured video to create a final cut. We also
show how information from various sensors and computer vision routines
can be combined to create different final cuts with little or no user
input.</p>
