<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I am a professor of computer science at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. I also direct the visual computing lab that focuses on problems residing at the intersection of computer vision, visual sensor networks, large-scale processing and computer graphics.</p>
<div class="about-more">
<p>Visual computing lab is involved in number of exciting research problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>coordination and control in ad hoc networks of visual sensor nodes;</li>
<li>integration of mobile cameras into traditional video surveillance networks;</li>
<li>nano-scale image analysis;</li>
<li>multi-object tracking;</li>
<li>streaming frameworks for on-line vision systems;</li>
<li>crowd synthesis and analysis;</li>
<li>depth and motion estimation from image pairs; and</li>
<li>virtual vision â€” 3D software laboratories for camera networks research.</li>
</ul>
